## About myself:

Hello, at this stage I am striving to acquire a new specialty. In the future, I want to get into the position of junior web developer, study and work in a team where colleagues can correct my knowledge. I speak English (A2) and have a wild desire to work on real projects. The priority is to reach the position of middle developer in a couple of years. Now I'm studying JS and I plan to study other frameworks and backend technologies along the way. In my free time, I read habra and a toaster.
I have no experience in web development, but I really want to develop and learn in this direction.
